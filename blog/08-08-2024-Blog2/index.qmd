Under the Bayesian paradigm, the statistical inference is conducted on the posterior distribution of parameters or the posterior predictive distribution of outcomes depending on the quantity of interest. In most cases, the posterior distributions are complex and known up to a constant factor (unknown) at best. It is Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) that makes the posterior estimation/inference doable and easier via simulating draws from the posterior distribution.

Today, how MCMC works is not the focus. Instead, I will use several examples to illustrate conducting Bayesian inference with Stan (based on Hamiltonian MCMC) in R.

First of all, we should install `rstan` package, the R interface to Stan, and the tools for compilation of C++ code in our computer. ([Refer to Stan official guide for details.](https://mc-stan.org/users/interfaces/rstan.html))

### Example 1, beta-binomial

$$
\theta \sim \text{Beta}(\alpha,\beta)
$$

$$
Y|\theta \sim \text{Bernoulli}(\theta)
$$ Observed data, $\{y_1,y_2,...,y_n\}$ (**iid**).

$$
p(\theta|\boldsymbol{y})\propto p(\boldsymbol{y}|\theta)\pi(\theta)\propto \theta^{\sum_i y_i}(1-\theta)^{n-\sum_i y_i}\theta^{\alpha-1}(1-\theta)^{\beta-1}
$$

Therefore,

$$
\theta|\boldsymbol{y}\sim \text{Beta}(\alpha+\sum_i y_i,\beta+n-\sum_i y_i)
$$

This posterior distribution is a well-known distribution and we don't bother to use Stan; it is chosen mainly to have theoretical results to compare with those obtained from Stan.
:::

```{r}
# specify prior and data generation mechanism
## hyperparameters
alpha = 1
beta = 1 ### thus an uninformative prior
##
theta = 0.45
n = 100
set.seed(0808)
y = rbinom(n, 1, prob = theta)
```

Before we call Stan in R, we need to create a `.stan` file (easy to do in Rstudio) written in Stan language, pretty straightforward and concise. ([Stan Reference Manual for language details](https://mc-stan.org/docs/reference-manual/))

```{stan output.var="beta_binomial_model"}
data { // Y is the observation vector with N observations
  int<lower=0> N;
  array[N] int Y;
}

parameters { // theta is bounded between 0 and 1
  real<lower=0, upper=1> theta;
}

model {
  theta ~ beta(1, 1); // specify prior distribution
  for(n in 1:N){
    Y[n] ~ binomial(1, theta); // specify model for data
  }
}

```

Now we can load `rstan` package and call `stan` function to simulate a posterior sample. (For this example, executable Stan code is inserted to output a `stanmodel` for `sampling` function as input. If we create a separate `.stan` file in the same directory, use `stan` function.)

```{r, message=FALSE}
library(rstan)
options(mc.cores = parallel::detectCores()) # parallel computing, one chain per core
rstan_options(auto_write = TRUE) # only need one time of compilation of C++ code
dat = list(N=n, Y=y) # consistent with data block in .stan file
beta_binomial_fit = sampling(beta_binomial_model, data = dat, algorithm="HMC")
```

::: {.callout-note appearance="simple"}
Initial points (values) for MCMC are likely to influence the time it takes for the chains to reach the stationary distribution (target posterior distribution). Thus, draws during sampling period (default, 1001-2000) of each chain (default, 4 chains) are collapsed together to form a final posterior sample.
:::

The match between the histogram of the sample and the theoretical density curve of the posterior distribution is satisfactory.

```{r, fig.cap="Posterior distribution of theta in beta-binomial example"}
theta_post = extract(beta_binomial_fit, permuted=T)$theta
hist(theta_post, freq = F, main = NULL, xlim = c(0,1),
     xlab = "theta|y")
lines(seq(0.1, 1, length.out = 1000), dbeta(seq(0.1, 1, length.out = 1000),
                              shape1 = alpha+sum(y),
                              shape2 = beta+n-sum(y)),
      col="red")
```
