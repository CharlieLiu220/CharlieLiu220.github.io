As is known that there are multiple themes for RStudio, I have used the light theme for a long time since I code most of the time during the day. Yet, yesterday at 1am when I switched between Github(with Night Mode) and RStudio, my eyes were crying. Below is what I figured out to make RStudio alternate between light and dark themes according to the time.

The basic idea is preparing a list of themes to be used and setting options and environmental variables for your RStudio.

### Step 1

Install [`rsthemes`](https://github.com/gadenbuie/rsthemes) package and a dozen of themes.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("gadenbuie/rsthemes")
# or
install.packages(
  "rsthemes",
  repos = c(gadenbuie = 'https://gadenbuie.r-universe.dev', getOption("repos"))
) # but this package is not updated to the newest version of R so stronly recommends installment from github
```

Then, install themes for use.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
rsthemes::install_rsthemes()
# list installed themes
rsthemes::list_rsthemes()
# try all themes
rsthemes::try_rsthemes()
```

### Step 2

Edit your `.Rprofile` via this `usethis::edit_r_profile()` within a R session in RStudio. Then, your `.Rprofile` will pop up in source panel of RStudio. Copy this (below) and save. You can customize your preferred themes and the time to switch to night mode and back.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
if (interactive() && requireNamespace("rsthemes", quietly = TRUE)) {
  # Set preferred themes if not handled elsewhere..
  rsthemes::set_theme_light("One Light {rsthemes}")  # light theme
  rsthemes::set_theme_dark("One Dark {rsthemes}") # dark theme

  # Whenever the R session restarts inside RStudio...
  setHook("rstudio.sessionInit", function(isNewSession) {
    # Automatically choose the correct theme based on time of day
    rsthemes::use_theme_auto(dark_start = "18:00", dark_end = "6:00")
  }, action = "append")
}
```

Restart R and done. The awkward thing is that the switch works only when you restart your R session but anyway easier than switching themes manually.
